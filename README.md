# SD_finetune_helper_scripts
A collection of basic Python scripts to help resize, aspect ratio, fix filewords, etc.

These are designed to simply be placed into a directory of files for them to work on, and the run.\
Some will create an /output folder, some will work on the original data (most likely just the filewords scripts).

Requirements should only be to install Pillow/PIL.

Good luck :)
